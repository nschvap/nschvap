# Hi, I'm Nicol√°s Schvap ([@nschvap](https://github.com/nschvap)).  

I speak **Spanish** and **English** (Still learning).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First and foremost, my goal is to become a Full Stack developer.

As for the [BACKEND](https://techterms.com/definition/backend), I haven't made a definitive decision yet, but I'm considering [Python](https://python.org) or perhaps [Go](https://go.dev).

As for the [FRONTEND](https://techterms.com/definition/frontend), I enjoy using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and it's my main language. I'm currently learning [React](https://react.dev), although I'm already quite proficient with it. I'm also interested in learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to improve my skills with React and potentially work with frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

I'd like to clarify that programming is currently a hobby for me, and I'm seeking to gain experience with all of these tools and technologies before committing to anything else.
