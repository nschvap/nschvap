# Hi, I'm Nicol√°s Schvap ([@nschvap](https://github.com/nschvap)).  

I speak **Spanish** and **English** (Still learning).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First and foremost, my goal is to become a Full Stack developer.

As for the backend, I haven't made a definitive decision yet, but I'm considering Python or perhaps Go.

As for the frontend, I enjoy using JavaScript and it's my main language. I'm currently learning React, although I'm already quite proficient with it. I'm also interested in learning TypeScript to improve my skills with React and potentially work with frameworks like Next.js.

I'd like to clarify that programming is currently a hobby for me, and I'm seeking to gain experience with all of these tools and technologies before committing to anything else.
